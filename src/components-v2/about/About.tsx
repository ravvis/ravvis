      I am a computer science undergraduate from IIIT Guwahati. The reason I like programming is because of the power it provides. With the right use of tech you can build a product that can touch thousands of lives.

      I have done several internships during my college life where I got to work on some of the path-breaking products.

      Currently I'm interning with INDmoney, building financial timeline products as a part of the goals team.
