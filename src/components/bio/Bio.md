I am a hobbyist software developer and an explorer.

In year 2019, I started my programming journey with C and been in this rabbit hole ever since. During this time I have worked on a range of technologies such as Javascript, Python, Vue, React, Django, MySQL, and the list goes on, and the fundamentals that were built at IIITG helped me always.

Currently, I am an Intern and exploring the world of large scale softwares, meeting new people and learning along.

Mostly, I have worked with frontend web technologies such as Vue, React, etc. and I am always intrigued by the scale a frontend architecture can achieve, and I am always ready to learn as the frontend world keeps on enhancing.

I am always looking forward to trying new ideas and work on exciting projects.

I also like to  wander different places, which might be a reason for me choosing IIIT Guwahati. I have travelled some places, including, north-east, pondicherry, chikmangloor, etc, and looking forward to cover more locations in the future.
